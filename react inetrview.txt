		https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

	How is React unidirectional?
		React, a Javascript library, uses unidirectional data flow. The data from the parent is known as props.
		You can only transfer data from parent to child and not vice versa.
		This means that the child components cannot update or modify the data on their own, 
		makeing sure that a clean data flow architecture is followed.

		These can be, say, a network request, which has your code communicating with a third party (and thus making the request,
		causing logs to be recorded, caches to be saved or updated, all sorts of effects that are outside the function.
