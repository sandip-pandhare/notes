	var vs let vs const
		https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/
	
	
	hoisting
		Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration
		https://www.programiz.com/javascript/hoisting
		
		
	closures
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a0I8ICR1Vg
		A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
		In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures
		
	Data types, primitive
		In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties.
		There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive

	binding in javascript
		With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

	NaN

	synchronous vs asynchronous
		https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-in-javascript/
		
	
	destructuring
		
	
	sread operator
		
	
	rest operator
	
	
	Objects in javascript
		https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_properties.asp
		
	
	instanceof
		// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof
		The instanceof operator tests to see if the prototype property of a constructor appears
		anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. The return value is a boolean value. 
		
	
	arrow functions
		https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_es6_arrow.asp
		Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:
		
	
	traversing
	
	call, apply, bind

	Event loop
		https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript/
	
	map,filter,reduce // reduce needs to revisit
		
	
	Callback function in javascript
		A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.
		A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.

	Fetch API
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
		
		fetch("url")
		.then( response => response.json() )
		.then( data => console.log(data) )
		
	promise, sync, await
	
	try, catch

	memoization in javascript, react
	https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/memoization-in-javascript-and-react/
	
	https://lo-victoria.com/a-look-at-react-hooks-usecallback
	The word 'memoized' or 'memoization' is an optimization technique to speed up expensive function calls by
	returning cached results instead of re-computing if the inputs of the function are the same.
